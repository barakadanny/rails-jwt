<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a Ruby on Rails application that includes a full authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It allows users to register, login, logout and check their current status. The application uses bcrypt to hash and store passwords securely in the database. The session storage is also secured using cookies. This app is a simple and easy to use solution for adding authentication functionality to your Ruby on Rails application.

Here's why use this template:
* Easy to use: The app is pre-configured and ready to use, making it easy for developers to add authentication functionality to their projects.
* Secure: Passwords are hashed and stored securely using bcrypt, and session storage is secured using cookies.
* Flexible: The app is a simple and easy to use solution, but can also serve as a starting point for more complex authentication systems ‚úäüèº.
